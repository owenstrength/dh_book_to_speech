# Senior Design Character Maps & Audio Generation

The project focused mainly on creating a realistic audiobook generation pipeline using large language models (LLMs) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. The goal was to generate character maps from book text, which would then be used to inform the TTS model to produce more contextually accurate and emotionally resonant audio renditions of the text.

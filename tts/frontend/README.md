# FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS


## READ FILES FROM THE AUDIO_OUTPUT FOLDER
The frontend needs to read files from the audio_output folder, which is created by the backend. To do this, you need to set up a static file server in your frontend application.

## Requirements
1. **Static File Serving**: Use a library or framework that supports static file serving. 
2. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure that your server is configured to allow cross-origin requests if your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains or ports.
3. **File Path**: The frontend should be able to construct the correct file path to access the audio files in the audio_output folder.

## Design Requirements
1. **User Interface**: Create a user interface that allows users to select and play audio
2. **Replay Functionality**: Implement functionality to replay audio files. with multiple playback speeds (e.g., 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x).
3. **Display Metadata**: Show relevant metadata about the audio files, such as character name, emotion, and duration.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage cases where audio files are missing or cannot be played.
